SolidusMailchimpSync
====================

**WIP**

Synchronizes Solidus data with [Mailchimp E-Commerce API](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/guides/getting-started-with-ecommerce/). (Mailchimp API 3.0)

This plugin does not do every kind of integration with Mailchimp that might be possible, it just focuses
on synchronizing data from Solidus to Mailchimp, by adding ActiveRecord lifecycle
hooks to Solidus models.

* Solidus `User` to Mailchimp `Customer`. (All customers currently added as status `transactional` in Mailchimp)
* Solidus `Product`, `Variant` (and images) to Mailchimp `Product` and `Variant`.
* Solidus `Order` (and their `LineItem`s), to Mailchimp `Cart` and `Order` (and their `Line`s).

Not all possible attributes that can be sync'd may yet be synced, work in progress.

Right now this plugin will connect everything in Solidus to a single Mailchimp `Store`, it does
not support multiple Mailchimp Stores.

We do not (yet?) support Mailchimp E-Commerce Link Tracking.

Actual sync'ing is done in background jobs using ActiveJob, configure your
ActiveJob adapter. All jobs are idempotent.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_mailchimp_sync to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_mailchimp_sync'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_mailchimp_sync:install
```

Your app will need to set `default_url_options[:host]` so urls can be
sent to mailchimp in background. :

     config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'mystore.example.org' }

Review the generated `./config/initializers/solidus_mailchimp_sync.rb` for required
and optional config, including mailchimp api keys.

You will need to have a Mailchimp List already created. You will need to create
a Mailchimp `Store` object belonging to that list, that we'll use for synchronization.
Not sure if that can be created through anything but API. You can create one by:

    bundle exec rake solidus_mailchimp_sync:create_mailchimp_store LIST_ID=list-id-from-mailchimp

Then add the storeID for created store to your configuration.

Before going live, you will probably want to bulk-add all your existing data --
if existing products aren't added, orders won't be able to be synced. This
could take a while:

    RAILS_ENV=production rake solidus_mailchimp_sync:bulk_sync

Known issues/To do
-------

* If a user changes their email addresses, their old orders may be no longer associated with
  them in mailchimp, they will wind up with two mailchimp customer records. (Mailchimp
  docs suggest you can change an existing Customer's id itself, but it didn't seem to work.
  can't change an existing Customer's email address)
* Debounce: This may send a LOT of updates to mailchimp, when you're editing something.
  Have an idea for an implementation debounce feature that could coalesce them.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

Some tests use VCR to record live transactions with mailchimp. To run these tests while
recording new cassettes, you will need to set ENV `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` and `MAILCHIMP_STORE_ID`.
**Note** these should be a test/dummy mailchimp account, as data will be edited by tests.

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
(No factories at present)
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_mailchimp_sync/factories'
```
